# Godot Orchestrator Documentation

This repository contains all the source files for the [Godot Orchestrator plug-in's](httsp://gihub.com/CraterCrash/godot-orchestrator) documentation, using Docusaurus.

## 🎨 Themes

The documentation is based on the Docusaurus classic theme with a number of customizations, including improved styles and components.

  * Links to external resources should use the `<ExternalLink href="...">text</ExternalLink>` component.

  * Two or more images, side-by-side should be wrapped using the `<Figures>...</Figures>` component.
